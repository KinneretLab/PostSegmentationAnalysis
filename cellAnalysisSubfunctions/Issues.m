% special cases to solve for cell analysis:
%  1  - Case where meeting point of different bonds is not classified as a
%  vertex for some reason. Talk to Noam about how to solve this. Happens in
%  cases like 2021_06_21_pos2, frame 9 (536,708). Also frames 122,158,
%  160... Sometimes, as in frame 638, can appear as two bonds instead of 3.

% 2 - Case when one cell is "inside" another, as in 2021_06_21_pos2, frame
% 144.
