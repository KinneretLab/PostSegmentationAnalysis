  # ============== Optimizer Parameters ===============

  # number of epochs, or training cycles the trainer goes through.
  # between every two epochs, to ensure we reach the best case scenario, the system randomizes the weights a little bit.
  # this can yield better results. However, more epochs means more time spent training.
  # default: 50
  num_epochs: 50

  # the learning rate is a tuning parameter describing how big the change in the weights can be. Since we use a SGM
  # optimizer within the code, this learning rate is no longer linear with the gradient and has a momentum.
  # Changing this value therefore can have little meaning in the long run.
  # default: 0.0005
  inital_learning_rate: 0.01

  # momentum is a factor that causes the learning rate to change based on how quickly the parameters change during
  # training. This is a very niche parameter to change but can speed up the process if done right.
  # default: 0.9
  momentum: 0.9

  # to allow the earlier epochs to do significant changes, we decrease the leaning rate throughout the epochs
  # this parameter specifies how often to reduce this learning rate
  # default: 7 (once per 7 epochs)
  lr_decay_step: 7

  # each time the learning rate is reduced, by what factor should the learning rate be reduced?
  # default: 0.1
  lr_decay_size: 0.1

  # ============== Misc. Training Parameters ===============

  # the percent of the available data that will be dedicated to validation rather than training.
  # changing this value can be helpful, but you would usually want to keep it around 0.1
  # default: 0.05
  valid_ratio: 0.05

  # Most cell databases do not perfectly classify all cells into "fakes" and "cells".
  # Such cells are "unclassified". Using this setting, you can choose how the trainer will these these as
  # -1 means ignore them completely from training
  # 0 means treat them as fakes
  # 1 means treat them as cells
  flag_unclassified: -1

  # Most cells do not perfectly fit into a square canvas with the original input size of the network.
  # therefore, we must make geometric adjustments so they can be used.
  # The decision of which geometric adjustment to make can greatly impact the performance of the network.
  # 0 means no stretching, but instead add black padding with the cell at the center.
  # 1 means rescale the cell to the correct size and add padding to make it square
  # 2 means stretch the cell to be exactly the square
  stretch_level: 2

# activation: in here, we use parameters used specifically when we are using a model, i.e activation.

  # the main directory where we expect to find folders containing the input images
